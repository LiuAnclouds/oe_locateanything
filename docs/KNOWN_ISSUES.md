## #001 README Chinese text corrupted via SSH heredoc (2026-07-08)

**Symptom**: `README.md` Chinese sections rendered as `鍚屾椂鍦?` etc. after editing over SSH.

**Trigger**: Editing UTF-8 content through `bash -c "cat > file <<'EOF' ... EOF"` from a session whose shell codepage did not agree with the terminal encoding.

**Root cause**: Double decoding. GBK bytes on the sending side were stored as UTF-8 on disk, then re-interpreted as UTF-8 on read. The transformation was not reversible because the intermediate stage lost information.

**Evidence**: `file README.md` reported `Unicode text, UTF-8 (with BOM)`, but Python `read_text(encoding="utf-8")` returned mojibake strings. Recovery attempts with `.encode("utf-8").decode("gbk")` and `.encode("latin1").decode("utf-8")` all failed.

**Fix**: Rewrote the affected Chinese paragraphs locally on Windows with the `Write` tool (guaranteed UTF-8 without BOM), then transferred with `scp` (binary transport, no shell decoding). Verified with a Python `sum(c in mojibake_chars for c in text) == 0` check on 4090.

**Alternatives considered**: In-place `sed` or `python3 -c` patches on 4090 — rejected because they still went through the same broken SSH pipeline for the replacement string.

**Prevention**: Never author non-ASCII content through heredoc over SSH. Author locally, `scp` to server, verify with a mojibake check before committing.

## #002 GitHub push over HTTPS 443 times out (2026-07-08)

**Symptom**: `git push origin main` on Windows repeatedly failed with `Failed to connect to github.com port 443`.

**Trigger**: Any push from either the 4090 or the Windows workstation that used the default HTTPS remote.

**Root cause**: Network policy blocking outbound TCP 443 to github.com from these hosts. SSH port 22 to github.com was not blocked.

**Evidence**: `curl -sI --max-time 8 https://github.com` returned `000`; `ssh -o BatchMode=yes git@github.com` returned a normal `Host key verification failed` (i.e. reached the server).

**Fix**: Switched the Windows clone's `origin` remote from `https://github.com/...` to `git@github.com:...`. First-attempt SSH push succeeded.

**Alternatives considered**: Retry HTTPS with a longer timeout — tried, still failed at 21s. HTTP proxy — no proxy available in the environment.

**Prevention**: Windows repo `.git/config` is now on the SSH remote permanently. Documented in the deployment runbook.

## #003 `hf download` fails with xet CAS 401 (2026-07-08)

**Symptom**: `hf download nvidia/LocateAnything-3B --local-dir ...` failed with `File reconstruction error: CAS Client Error: ... 401 Unauthorized`.

**Trigger**: `hf-hub >= 1.22.0` combined with `HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com`.

**Root cause**: `hf-hub 1.22` defaults to the new xet CAS protocol, which routes reconstruction requests to `cas-server.xethub.hf.co` directly. `hf-mirror.com` does not proxy xet CAS, so those requests hit the real HuggingFace CAS without auth and return 401.

**Evidence**: Full stack trace ended at `xet_get` calling `https://cas-server.xethub.hf.co/v2/reconstructions/...`. `pip show hf-xet` confirmed 1.5.1 was installed.

**Fix**: Downgraded `hf-hub` to `<0.30` (`pip install "huggingface_hub<0.30" hf_transfer`), which does not use xet and honours `HF_ENDPOINT` for the whole download flow.

**Alternatives considered**: `HF_HUB_DISABLE_XET=1` env var — worked, but still slow (~4 MB/s from hf-mirror because `hf_transfer` was deprecated in 1.22). Downgrade unlocks `hf_transfer` acceleration too.

**Prevention**: Pin `huggingface_hub<0.30` in the LocateAnything conda env; document in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` if we ever revise the download flow.

## #004 `pip install torch==2.8.0 --index-url cu121` cannot find distribution (2026-07-08)

**Symptom**: `pip install torch==2.8.0 torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121` returned `Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement torch==2.8.0`.

**Trigger**: Trying to match torch 2.8.0 with a CUDA 12.1 wheel because the 4090 host runs driver 535 / CUDA 12.2.

**Root cause**: The `whl/cu121` index only ships torch up to 2.5.1. torch 2.6+ wheels only exist for cu124/cu126, which require driver ≥ 545.

**Evidence**: pip error listed available `cu121` versions: `2.1.0+cu121 ... 2.5.1+cu121`.

**Fix**: Installed `torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121`. The `locateanything` and `oellm` conda envs are independent, so torch version divergence between them is fine.

**Alternatives considered**: Upgrade host driver to 545 — rejected because it requires sudo and could affect other users on the shared 4090.

**Prevention**: When picking torch/CUDA on a shared host, always check `nvidia-smi` driver → CUDA cap first. Pin torch in the conda env spec once decided.

## #005 Baseline OOM at 9.61 GB single attention block (2026-07-08)

**Symptom**: `demo_min.py` crashed with `CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 9.61 GiB` on a 24 GB RTX 4090 during MoonViT `sdpa_attention`.

**Trigger**: Feeding the original 1920×1280 `test-cat.jpg` directly through `LocateAnythingWorker.detect(...)` with no image resize.

**Root cause**: MoonViT is native-resolution. A 1920×1280 image at patch 14 produces ~12,500 tokens; a full-attention matrix `12500 × 12500` in fp16 is ~300 MB per head, ~4.8 GB per layer, and multi-layer intermediate storage blows past 9 GB.

**Evidence**: Traceback rooted in `modeling_vit.py:150 sdpa_attention` with `F.scaled_dot_product_attention`.

**Fix**: Added a downscale step in `main/examples/demo_min.py` that resizes any input whose long side exceeds 1024 px (`MAX_LONG_SIDE = 1024`), reducing token count to ~4000 and memory to a few hundred MB.

**Alternatives considered**: `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` — masks the fragmentation but does not remove the O(N²) attention. Streaming attention — would require patching MoonViT. Both rejected as heavier than a bounded resize.

**Prevention**: Any script that feeds MoonViT native-res input must state its assumed max resolution up front. `MAX_LONG_SIDE` is a module-level constant to keep this discoverable.

## #006 `oellm_build` errors on unknown `vit_kwargs` keyword (2026-07-09)

**Symptom**: First launch of `oellm_build --model_name locateanything-lm-3b` died with `TypeError: LocateAnythingLanguageOnlyApi.compile() got an unexpected keyword argument 'vit_kwargs'`.

**Trigger**: Any custom Api that omits the `vit_kwargs` parameter in its `compile()` signature.

**Root cause**: `leap_llm/apis/oellm_build.py::main` invokes `model.compile(vit_kwargs=..., llm_kwargs=...)` uniformly for every model, whether or not the model produces a vision HBM.

**Evidence**: Traceback pointed at `oellm_build.py:665`.

**Fix**: Every custom Api accepts `vit_kwargs` in `compile()`, even when it never produces a vision HBM — just ignores it. Both `LocateAnythingLanguageApi` and `LocateAnythingApi` follow this convention.

**Alternatives considered**: Patch `oellm_build.py` to introspect the signature — rejected because it modifies wheel code needlessly.

**Prevention**: Api template docstring records the required `compile(self, vit_kwargs=None, llm_kwargs=None)` signature.

## #007 `leap_export` fails with `AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'type'` (2026-07-09)

**Symptom**: Compile crashed at `hbdk4/compiler/leap.py:278` on `return_types = [v.type for v in results]`.

**Trigger**: A leap DSL `build()` method returning a tuple whose elements include intermediate Python `list`s.

**Root cause**: `leap.leap_export` expects the traced function to return a flat sequence of leaf tensors. Nested containers are not decomposed automatically.

**Evidence**: Our `LocateAnythingTextModel.build()` returned `(logits, new_keys, new_values)` where `new_keys` / `new_values` were Python lists of per-layer tensors. Upstream `Qwen2_5_VLTextModel.build()` uses `return token_logits, *new_keys, *new_values` — same shape flattened.

**Fix**: Changed `return logits, new_keys, new_values` → `return (logits, *new_keys, *new_values)`. PyTorch `forward()` (used only for calibration) still returns the tuple-of-lists form because torch does not care.

**Alternatives considered**: Wrapping every layer's KV in a `torch.stack` — rejected because leap.TensorType input signatures declare 2×num_layers separate tensors.

**Prevention**: Every leap DSL `build()` must return only `leap.Tensor` leaves. When in doubt, `[isinstance(v, leap.Tensor) for v in results]` should be all True.

## #008 LocateAnything vocab 152681 crashes decode compile_hbo (2026-07-09)

**Symptom**: `oellm_build --model_name locateanything-lm-3b` completed prefill (`prefill.hbo` 1.6 GB produced) but the python process died silently in the decode compile_hbo stage. No traceback in the log; last line was an `[info]` warning.

**Trigger**: `LocateAnythingLanguageApi.compile()` passing `input_no_padding=True, output_no_padding=True` in the `compile_hbo` kwargs, combined with `vocab_size = 152681`.

**Root cause**: BPU DMA reads outputs in 64-byte aligned chunks. hbdk4's `output_no_padding=True` promises "do not pad the last dim". LocateAnything's lm_head output last dim is `vocab_size × sizeof(fp16) = 152681 × 2 = 305362` bytes, `305362 % 64 = 50 ≠ 0`. hbdk4 emits `[info] output_no_padding=true will not be applied ... get 305362`, then hits an internal path bug on the decode stage that aborts python without a traceback. The prefill stage happened to complete before the abort because it exercises a different code path in hbdk4. The Qwen2.5-VL baseline uses vocab 151936, and `151936 × 2 = 303872` is divisible by 64, which is why the same `no_padding=True` kwargs work there.

**Evidence**: `log tail`:
```
[2026-07-09 15:26:24.649] [info] This configuration `output_no_padding=true` will not be applied.
When the product of the C dimension and the element size exceeds 16384, the product must be
divisible by 64, but get 305362.
```
`ps -p <pid>` = DEAD. No OOM in dmesg. No traceback in log. Produced `prefill.hbo` (1.6 GB) but not `decode.hbo` or `.hbm`. `Function 'compile_hbo' done` line present for prefill (4180 s), missing for decode.

**Fix**: Removed `input_no_padding` and `output_no_padding` from the compile_hbo kwargs in `toolchain/leap_llm/apis/model/locateanything_language.py`. hbdk4 now falls back to its default automatic padding (pads the last dim from 305362 to 305408 bytes internally). Host runtime later slices `logits[..., :152681]` to drop the 46-byte pad.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Pad vocab_size to 152704** (23 dummy embeddings, zero weight): also works but requires touching config + model + Api + host sampling; heavier than a two-line kwargs change. Rejected on the principle "let the compiler do its job".
- **Per-stage kwargs (keep no_padding=True for prefill, drop for decode)**: adds branching in the Api that we would then have to maintain. Rejected on grounds of minimality.
- **`--w_bits 8` for the lm_head**: lm_head byte count would become 152681 × 1 = 152681, still `% 64 = 25 ≠ 0`. Does not fix the issue.

**Prevention**: When picking `no_padding` flags, always check `vocab_size × sizeof(dtype) % 64 == 0` for the lm_head output. Add this as a compile-time assertion in `LocateAnythingLanguageApi.__init__` (TBD).
